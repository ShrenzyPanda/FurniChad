## **Current Situation:**
<p>Online furniture shopping has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many customers preferring the convenience of browsing and purchasing furniture from the comfort of their homes. However, there are still several problems associated with online furniture shopping that can make the experience less than ideal for some customers.

One of the major such problems is limited customization options:- Online furniture stores often offer limited customization options, making it difficult for customers to get exactly what they want. Customers may have difficulty visualizing how furniture will look in that customized form, leading to uncertainty and hesitation when making a purchase.
